Review of GDHQ 2D Project

Basically running through the program again, reviewing the logic I implemented in version 1.0, tweaking or optimizing where I think I can do so.  Trying to refine my use of a singleton Game Manager, and trying to simplify / minimize code repetition.
Gave the Player the ability to rotate 360 deg, and also developed a new attack pattern that allows wave to come from 360 deg, initially aiming for the LKP of Player on instantiation.
Trying to do as much as I can initially without refering to old code.
